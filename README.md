# Covid 19 Data Analysis project

## Introduction: 
November 2019 was the first time the world heard about the covid 19;
after that, each person and industry knew about it from bottom to
top, east to west and north to south. [Covid19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19)

It's been more than two years since we survived the pandemic,
and also it taught us many things about human civilization.
 Everything comes with a price, and to learn these lessons,
  what price did we pay?  

This repository is Aim to Highlights How coronavirus has affected
the world and the status of the vaccination process with the help
 of data analysis.
